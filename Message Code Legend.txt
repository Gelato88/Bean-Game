Issues:
cannot trade more than 9 of a card at a time
does not show how many cards a player holds
does not show if flipped cards are offered in a trade request
game allows to plant traded cards, then continue trading
first player to respond yes gets trade
can still plant after trading before flipping
possible to stack responses while waiting for server when ending turn
